<p>inf-test works!  hello world</p>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
Here router outlet wont get activated as its searching for /inf/something here and it cant be empty so /inf wont match <br>
here and inf is not rendered <br>

In case of root level router outlet if its getting pointed to itself like / then it will match '' blank and some name here as well
